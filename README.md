**Acontext PPT Girl Slide Generator** is an intelligent PPT slide generation system powered by [Acontext](https://acontext.io). Simply chat with **"PPT Girl"** (an AI assistant) about your presentation topic, and she will automatically create a series of beautiful, cyberpunk-style slide images ready for your presentation.

## 🎯 Core Functionality

### What Does It Do?

**Transform text into professional PPT slides** through natural conversation:

1. **📝 Input**: You provide presentation content (text, paragraphs, topics, or outlines)
2. **🧠 Planning**: PPT Girl analyzes your content and proposes a slide-by-slide outline (titles + bullet points)
3. **✏️ Review**: You review and confirm the outline
4. **🎨 Generation**: PPT Girl generates 16:9 cyberpunk-style slide images using AI image generation
5. **📦 Delivery**: Each slide image is automatically stored and accessible via URLs

### Key Features of PPT Generation

- **🎨 Consistent Visual Style**: All slides share a unified cyberpunk aesthetic (neon lights, holographic effects, futuristic backgrounds)
- **📐 Smart Layout**: Clean, professional layouts with ample space for text overlays
- **🔄 Interactive Workflow**: Confirm outlines before generation, iterate on specific slides
- **💾 Automatic Storage**: All generated slides are stored in Acontext Disk for easy access
- **🧠 Context Awareness**: Remembers your previous slides and maintains visual consistency across sessions

## 🤔 Why Acontext? The Key Integration Benefits

**Acontext is not optional** - it's what makes this PPT generator intelligent and practical. Here's why:

### 1. **Persistent Memory for Multi-Slide Presentations** 🧠
**Problem**: Generating a full presentation requires multiple rounds of conversation. Without memory, the AI would forget:
- What slides were already created
- The visual style and theme you agreed upon
- The overall structure of your presentation

**Solution with Acontext**: Every chat session persists to an Acontext Session. PPT Girl remembers:
- All previously generated slides in your current presentation
- Your preferences (e.g., "use more purple tones", "make slides simpler")
- The presentation structure and context

**Real Impact**: You can say "add one more slide about pricing" or "make slide 3 more detailed" - and PPT Girl knows exactly which slide you're referring to.

### 2. **Semantic Search for Style Consistency** 🔍
**Problem**: When generating multiple slides, maintaining visual consistency is challenging. You might want:
- All slides to share similar color schemes
- Consistent background elements
- Similar layouts across related slides

**Solution with Acontext**: Before generating each new slide, Acontext performs semantic search to retrieve:
- Previous slide generation prompts
- Your feedback and style preferences
- Related slides from the same presentation

**Real Impact**: When you say "make this slide match the style of the intro slide," PPT Girl can find and reference your earlier slides automatically.

### 3. **Skill Learning for Better Results Over Time** 📈
**Problem**: Every user has different preferences. Some like minimal designs, others prefer detailed backgrounds. Without learning, the AI starts from scratch each time.

**Solution with Acontext**: Acontext Space learns from completed presentations:
- Your preferred slide styles
- Common patterns in your presentations (e.g., "you always include a conclusion slide")
- Successful slide structures that worked well before

**Real Impact**: The more presentations you create, the better PPT Girl understands your style. Your 10th presentation will be much more aligned with your preferences than your first.

### 4. **Automatic File Management for Generated Slides** 📁
**Problem**: Generated slide images need to be stored, organized, and easily accessible. Managing files manually is tedious and error-prone.

**Solution with Acontext Disk**:
- All generated slides are automatically stored in Acontext Disk
- Each slide has a unique URL for easy sharing and embedding
- Files are organized by session and date
- No need to manually download or manage files

**Real Impact**: You can view all your generated slides in one place, download them in bulk, or share individual slides instantly.

### 5. **Context Compression for Long Presentations** 💾
**Problem**: Creating a 20-slide presentation involves many messages, tool calls, and generated images. Without compression, the conversation context becomes too large for the LLM to process efficiently.

**Solution with Acontext**: 
- Automatic context compression when conversations get long
- Important information (slide structures, confirmed outlines) is preserved
- Less relevant intermediate messages are compressed or summarized

**Real Impact**: You can create presentations of any length without hitting token limits or losing important context.

### 6. **Cross-Session Intelligence** 🔄
**Problem**: Without memory, each new conversation starts from zero. You can't reference slides from previous presentations or build upon past work.

**Solution with Acontext**:
- Search across all your previous presentations
- Reference slides from past sessions
- Build upon existing slide libraries

**Real Impact**: "Create a presentation similar to the one I made last week" becomes possible. PPT Girl can find and reference your previous work.

---

**Bottom Line**: Acontext transforms PPT Girl from a "one-shot slide generator" into an **intelligent presentation assistant** that learns your preferences, maintains context across sessions, and delivers increasingly better results over time.

## 📖 Usage Example

Here's a real conversation flow with PPT Girl:

### Example 1: Creating a Product Launch Presentation

**You**: "I need a presentation about our new AI chatbot product launch. It should cover: introduction, features, pricing, and next steps."

**PPT Girl**: 
> I'll help you create a presentation about your AI chatbot product launch. Let me propose a slide outline:
> 
> **Slide 1: Introduction**
> - Welcome to the AI Chatbot Launch
> - Revolutionizing customer support
> 
> **Slide 2: Key Features**
> - 24/7 intelligent support
> - Natural language understanding
> - Multi-platform integration
> 
> **Slide 3: Pricing**
> - Flexible pricing tiers
> - Enterprise solutions available
> 
> **Slide 4: Next Steps**
> - Sign up for early access
> - Schedule a demo
> 
> Does this outline work for you? Should I proceed with generating the slide images?

**You**: "Yes, looks good! Make the introduction slide more dramatic."

**PPT Girl**: 
> [Generates 4 slide images using image_generate tool]
> 
> ✅ **Slide 1: Introduction** (updated with more dramatic visuals)
> 🖼️ Image: [URL to generated slide]
> 
> ✅ **Slide 2: Key Features**
> 🖼️ Image: [URL to generated slide]
> 
> ✅ **Slide 3: Pricing**
> 🖼️ Image: [URL to generated slide]
> 
> ✅ **Slide 4: Next Steps**
> 🖼️ Image: [URL to generated slide]
> 
> Your presentation is ready! All slides have been saved and are accessible via the URLs above. You can download them or use them directly in your presentation software.

### Example 2: Iterating on Slides

**You** (in a later conversation): "I want to add one more slide about customer testimonials before the pricing slide."

**PPT Girl** (remembers your previous presentation):
> I'll add a testimonials slide between the features and pricing slides. Let me propose:
> 
> **Slide 3: Customer Testimonials**
> - "Best chatbot we've ever used" - Company A
> - "Reduced support tickets by 60%" - Company B
> - "Easy to integrate" - Company C
> 
> Should I generate this slide with the same cyberpunk style to match your previous slides?

**You**: "Yes, but use more purple tones to differentiate it slightly."

**PPT Girl**:
> [Generates the slide with purple-toned cyberpunk style]
> 
> ✅ **Slide 3: Customer Testimonials** (purple-toned, matching your previous style)
> 🖼️ Image: [URL to generated slide]
> 
> Done! This slide will fit perfectly with your existing presentation.

**Key Takeaway**: Notice how PPT Girl remembers:
- Your previous presentation structure
- The visual style you used
- How to maintain consistency while allowing variations

This intelligence comes from **Acontext's persistent memory and semantic search** - without it, PPT Girl would have no memory of your previous slides and couldn't maintain consistency.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/pnpm
- A Supabase account ([create one here](https://database.new))
- An Acontext account ([sign up here](https://acontext.io))
- An OpenAI API key (or compatible API endpoint)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbt1909432/acontext-agent-playground-ppt.git nextjs-with-supabase-acontext
cd nextjs-with-supabase-acontext
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. **Set up Supabase**

   - Create a new project at [Supabase Dashboard](https://database.new)
   - Note your `Project URL` and `Anon (publishable) key`

4. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase (required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-supabase-publishable-or-anon-key

# Acontext (required for full functionality)
ACONTEXT_API_KEY=your-acontext-api-key
ACONTEXT_BASE_URL=https://api.acontext.com/api/v1  # Optional, defaults to this

# OpenAI LLM (required)
OPENAI_LLM_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_LLM_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # or gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, etc.
OPENAI_LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.7
OPENAI_LLM_MAX_TOKENS=2000

# Browser Use Cloud (optional, for browser automation)
BROWSER_USE_API_KEY=your-browser-use-cloud-api-key
```

5. **Set up database schema**

   - Open your Supabase project
   - Go to **SQL Editor**
   - Run the SQL from `specs/001-chatbot-openai/schema.sql`
   - This creates tables for `chat_sessions` and `chat_messages`
   - For Acontext integration, also run `specs/001-chatbot-openai/migration-acontext.sql`

6. **Run the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your application.

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Customizing the UI

The UI is built with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** components, making it easy to customize:

1. **Theme Colors**: Edit `tailwind.config.ts` to change color schemes
2. **Components**: All UI components are in `components/ui/` - modify as needed
3. **Layout**: Main pages are in `app/` directory
4. **Homepage**: Customize `app/page.tsx` for your landing page
5. **Chat Interface**: Modify `components/chatbot-panel.tsx` for chat UI changes

### Customizing the Avatar

The agent avatar can be customized in several ways. In this PPT Girl branch, a nurse-style anime character is already wired up as the default avatar.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./public/fonts/character1/ppt girl.png" alt="PPT Girl - Homepage Character" width="300" />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="./public/fonts/character1/ppt_girl_chatbot.png" alt="PPT Girl - Chatbot Avatar" width="200" />
</div>

1. **Character Image**: Replace the image at `/public/fonts/ppt girl.png` with your own character/logo (keep the same filename to avoid code changes), or update `components/parallax-character.tsx` to point to a different path
2. **Homepage Avatar**: The homepage hero section uses the parallax character component to display `ppt girl.png` floating beside the copy
3. **Chat Avatar**: Modify the avatar display in `components/chatbot-panel.tsx` if you also want PPT Girl (or another character) in the chat UI

Example locations:
- `components/parallax-character.tsx` - Homepage parallax character (uses `/fonts/ppt girl.png`)
- `public/fonts/character1/ppt girl.png` - Default character asset used on the homepage
- `public/fonts/character1/ppt_girl_chatbot.png` - Default chat avatar asset
- `app/page.tsx` - Homepage layout and PPT Girl landing copy

### Adding Custom Tools

Tools are defined as OpenAI function calling schemas. To add your own tool:

1. **Create a tool file** in `lib/` (e.g., `lib/my-custom-tool.ts`):

```typescript
export function getMyToolSchema() {
  return {
    type: "function" as const,
    function: {
      name: "my_custom_tool",
      description: "Description of what your tool does",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          param1: {
            type: "string",
            description: "Parameter description",
          },
        },
        required: ["param1"],
      },
    },
  };
}

export async function executeMyTool(args: { param1: string }) {
  // Your tool logic here
  return {
    result: "Tool execution result",
  };
}
```

2. **Register the tool** in `lib/openai-client.ts`:

```typescript
// Add to getAvailableTools function
if (shouldIncludeMyTool) {
  tools.push(getMyToolSchema());
}

// Add to executeToolCall function
if (name === "my_custom_tool") {
  const args = JSON.parse(argsJson || "{}");
  return await executeMyTool(args);
}
```

3. **Wire it into the chat API** in `app/api/chatbot/route.ts`:

```typescript
// The tools are automatically included when calling chatCompletionStream
```

**Existing Tool Examples:**
- `lib/browser-use.ts` - Browser automation
- `lib/acontext-disk-tools.ts` - File system operations
- `lib/acontext-experience-search-tool.ts` - Experience search
- `lib/acontext-todo-tool.ts` - Todo management

### Customizing Acontext Integration

The Acontext integration is modular and can be customized:

- **Session Management**: `lib/acontext-integration.ts` - Modify session creation and management
- **Client Configuration**: `lib/acontext-client.ts` - Adjust Acontext client settings
- **Tool Integration**: `lib/acontext-disk-tools.ts` - Customize disk tool behavior
- **Experience Search**: `lib/acontext-experience-search-tool.ts` - Modify search logic

- Chat interface includes file upload button (📎 icon)
- Supports multiple file uploads
- Files are uploaded to Acontext Disk via Artifacts API
- Uploaded files are referenced in messages, AI can read file content
- **Image Support**: Uses OpenAI Vision API, AI can directly view and analyze images
- **File List View**: View all files stored in Acontext Disk

#### 4. File System Tools (Function Calling) ✅
- LLM can autonomously read/write files on Acontext Disk through tool functions
- Includes official `DISK_TOOLS` exposed via OpenAI Tool Schema: `write_file`, `read_file`, `replace_string`, `list_artifacts`, `download_file`
- Chat API automatically provides these tools when Acontext is configured
- Tools automatically select existing disk (or create one if needed), no frontend intervention required

### File Upload Usage

#### Frontend (Chat Interface)

1. **Click attachment button**: 📎 (paperclip) icon button next to input box
2. **Select files**: Opens file picker, supports multiple files
3. **View preview**: Selected files appear above input box with filename
4. **Remove attachment**: Click ❌ button next to file to remove
5. **Send message**: Enter message and send, files upload with message
6. **View file list**: Click "Files" button to view all files in Acontext Disk

#### API Usage

Send a message with attachments:

```typescript
const response = await fetch("/api/chatbot", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: "Analyze this document",
    sessionId: "your-session-id",
    attachments: [
      {
        filename: "document.pdf",
        content: "base64-encoded-content", // base64 encoded file content
        mimeType: "application/pdf",
      },
      {
        filename: "image.png",
        content: "base64-encoded-image",
        mimeType: "image/png",
      },
    ],
    enableSemanticSearch: true, // optional, default true
  }),
});
```

**Attachment Format:**
- `filename` (string): File name
- `content` (string): Base64 encoded file content (without `data:image/png;base64,` prefix)
- `mimeType` (string): MIME type, e.g., `application/pdf`, `image/png`, `text/plain`

#### View File List

```typescript
// List all artifacts
const response = await fetch("/api/acontext/artifacts");
const data = await response.json();

if (data.success) {
  console.log(`Found ${data.count} files:`, data.artifacts);
}

// List files from specific disk
const response = await fetch("/api/acontext/artifacts?diskId=your-disk-id");
```

### Database Migration

Run the following SQL to add Acontext-related fields:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File location: specs/001-chatbot-openai/migration-acontext.sql
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure Acontext is configured in `.env.local`:

```env
ACONTEXT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ACONTEXT_BASE_URL=https://api.acontext.com/api/v1  # Optional, defaults to this

# Bypass proxy for Acontext API (local development only)
# When set to true or 1, Acontext API requests bypass HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY
# Other service requests still use proxy
ACONTEXT_BYPASS_PROXY=true  # Optional, only needed for local development
```

### Implementation Details

**Key Files:**
- `lib/acontext-integration.ts` - Acontext integration utility functions
- `lib/acontext-disk-tools.ts` - Acontext disk file system tools (Function Calling)
- `app/api/chatbot/route.ts` - Updated chat API with Acontext integration
- `components/chatbot-panel.tsx` - File upload UI
- `types/chat.ts` - Updated type definitions

**Key Functions:**
- `getOrCreateAcontextSession()` - Get or create Acontext session
- `searchRelevantContext()` - Semantic search for relevant context
- `uploadFileToAcontext()` - Upload file to Acontext
- `storeMessageInAcontext()` - Store message in Acontext

**Notes:**
- **Optional Integration**: If `ACONTEXT_API_KEY` is not configured, all Acontext features automatically skip, basic chat functionality remains unaffected
- **Error Handling**: All Acontext operations have error handling, failures don't affect main flow
- **Performance**: Semantic search retrieves recent messages as context, production may need more refined search strategy
